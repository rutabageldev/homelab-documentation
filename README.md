# Homelab Documentation

This repository contains documentation, inventories, and reference materials for my personal homelab environment and related tools.

It’s intended to track hardware configurations, portable kits, setup workflows, and recovery utilities in a clear, version-controlled format.

## 📁 Contents

- [`jump-kit-inventory.md`](./jump-kit-inventory.md)  
  A curated inventory of my mobile troubleshooting and development kit, optimized for travel and quick access to homelab systems.

## 🧠 Goals

- Maintain accurate, lightweight documentation for homelab operations
- Track portable hardware and utilities for remote development and diagnostics
- Document repeatable processes (e.g., OS installs, firmware updates, and jump box use)
- Version and evolve kits and tools over time
